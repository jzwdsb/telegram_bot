# Stock Information Feature Roadmap - MVP Approach

## Overview
Implementation of stock market information functionality for the Telegram bot using an MVP approach. Start with basic commands and iterate to build more advanced features.

## MVP Features (Phase 1)

### Core MVP Commands
1. **`/price {stock}`** - Get current stock price and basic info
2. **`/news {stock}`** - Get latest news for a specific stock  
3. **Reusable Infrastructure** - Foundation for future `/subscribe` functionality

### Technical Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Trait-based provider abstraction for stock data providers
- [x] Alpha Vantage integration with rate limiting
- [x] Database schema design for future subscription features
- [x] DynamoDB implementation
- [x] Error handling and logging

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Phase 1.1: Provider Architecture ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Design trait-based abstraction for stock data providers
- [x] Implement core data structures (StockQuote, StockNews, Sentiment)
- [x] Create provider configuration system
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling

#### Phase 1.2: Alpha Vantage Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- [x] Implement Alpha Vantage provider using existing crate
- [x] Add rate limiting (5 requests/minute)
- [x] Implement quote fetching functionality
- [x] Add news API stub (when supported by crate)
- [x] Create provider factory for extensibility

#### Phase 1.3: Database Schema Design ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Design DynamoDB table structures for future features
- [x] Implement database abstraction layer
- [x] Create DynamoDB client implementation

- [ ] Update bot message handling to support new commands
- [ ] Add proper error handling and user feedback

#### Phase 2.2: Message Formatting
- [ ] Create formatted messages for stock price display
- [ ] Design user-friendly error messages

- [ ] Test rate limiting behavior
- [ ] Documentation update for new commands

### Phase 3: Iteration Planning (Future)

#### Phase 3.1: Subscription Foundation
- [ ] Add `/subscribe {stock}` command
- [ ] Implement basic subscription storage
- [ ] Add `/unsubscribe {stock}` and `/subscriptions` commands
- [ ] Basic group management

#### Phase 3.2: Scheduled Updates

## MVP Message Formats

### Price Command Response
```
üìà AAPL Stock Quote

Price: $150.25 (+$2.35, +1.58%)
Open: $148.90
High: $151.20
Low: $147.80
Volume: 45.2M
Market Cap: $2.4T

Last Updated: 2024-01-15 16:00 EST
Data provided by Alpha Vantage
```

### News Command Response (Placeholder)
```
üì∞ AAPL News

üöß News feature coming soon!
Currently using Alpha Vantage crate which doesn't yet support news API.

For now, try these alternatives:
‚Ä¢ Check financial news websites
‚Ä¢ Use the /price command for current stock data
```

### Error Messages
```
‚ùå Stock symbol not found: "INVALID"
Please check the symbol and try again.

‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limit exceeded
Please wait a moment before trying again.

üîß Service temporarily unavailable
Please try again later.
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Stock Data Provider
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Feature Flags (for future use)
STOCK_FEATURES_ENABLED=true
STOCK_NEWS_ENABLED=false  # Until news API is available
```

## Success Metrics for MVP

- Commands respond within 3 seconds
- Stock price data is accurate and current
- Error handling provides clear user feedback
- Rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion
- Foundation supports easy addition of subscription features

## Next Iteration Planning

After MVP validation:
1. **User Feedback**: Collect usage patterns and feature requests
2. **News API**: Wait for alpha_vantage crate news support or implement custom API
3. **Subscription Features**: Build on MVP foundation for group subscriptions
4. **Scheduled Updates**: Add daily automated updates
5. **AI Integration**: Add OpenAI summarization for news

## Risk Mitigation

- **API Limits**: Implement robust rate limiting and caching
- **News API Availability**: Start with placeholder, iterate when available
- **User Experience**: Focus on clear, helpful error messages
- **Performance**: Async operations with proper timeout handling
